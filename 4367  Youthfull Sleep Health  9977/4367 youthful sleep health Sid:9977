<p>If you're constantly feeling <b>groggy, tired and totally sapped of energy</b> when you need it the most...</p>
<p>It's likely you suffer from Non-Restorative Sleep, or NRS.</p>

<p><a href="https://{domain}/{lpurl}" style="color: blue; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">[Dr. Sam Report: Defeating NRS WITHOUT Dangerous Sedatives Or Melatonin]</a></p>

<p>NRS affects millions of Americans every night… Yet most folks don't even know what it is.</p>
<p>It's categorized as sleep that <b>doesn't allow you to wake up feeling refreshed and re-energized</b>, but rather fatigued and exhausted as if you hadn't slept at all…</p>

<p>Even if you slept a <b>full eight hours</b> or more...</p>

<p>Poor sleep can absolutely <b>RUIN your health and quality of life</b>… Even if you live a very healthy lifestyle otherwise.</p>

<p>Because <b>you can't make up for poor sleep</b> with good nutrition or exercise… no matter how hard you try.</p>

<p>And when you let NRS take over your life and you don't address it, you'll see its side effects everywhere you look:</p>

<ul>
<li>You become <b>mentally weaker</b></li>
<li>You're less concerned about <b>losing money</b></li>
<li>You have <b>less empathy</b></li>
<li>You're <b>less attractive</b></li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is, there's <a href="https://{domain}/{lpurl}" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">a simple, ten-second trick</a> you can start doing tonight that will give you <b>the best night's sleep of your life…</b></p>

<p>And allow you to <b>wake up feeling totally refreshed and ready to take on the day</b>… no more groggy, unfocused mornings...</p>

<p>I outline it all in my shocking new report…</p>

<p>Because it is possible for normal folks to defeat NRS for good and <b>sleep like kings and queens</b>, with just this one little tweak to their night-time routine…</p>

<p>God Bless,</p>
<p>Dr. Sam Walters</p>

<p><b>P.S.</b> Did you know that almost <b>HALF of all Americans say they feel sleepy during the day</b> <em>between 3 and 7 days a week?</em></p>

<p>That's according to the Centers for Disease Control.</p>

<p>Which is, <b>sedative-style sleep aids do NOTHING to help defeat Non-Restorative Sleep.</b></p>

<p>And that's why millions of Americans STILL suffer with it, no matter how long they try to fight it with sedatives.</p>
